# Config Files

This is my personal config file repository. Within those folders i store my scripts and configs i reuse whenever i setup a new environment. Beside the config files the most folders contain a detailed step by step description which commands at what point have to be done. This allows me to reproduce the installation everytime and using git to track the changes over time.
